# Steps to create a project:

1) Create classes for separate entities

    `class Maze` - initializes co-ordinates of the maze
    
    `class Tracer` - stores the current co-ordinate and the cost of getting to that co-ordinate
    
    `class BFS` - BFS alorithem for maze traversal and finding the shortest path
    `class main`
